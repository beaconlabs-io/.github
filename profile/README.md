Beacon Labs is an R&D institution for a positive sum world through exploring inclusive coordination design. 

We will bring plural funding mecahnisms reflected plural values into a public goods space. We enable funding based on diverse value systems through a statistical approach. Current public goods funding makes a decision based on a single value framework, even though public goods has different outcomes which they would like to achieve. We envision a future where each public good receives funding optimized for its own unique goals, and we aim to build protocols that support Ethereum to thrive sustainably.

By evaluating and measuring the impact of public goods and funding mechanisms, we reflect the diversity of values they embody. While impact evaluation / measurement has been developed in recent years, most progress has focused on measuring the impact of OSS(open-source software). In contrast, there is a lack of evaluating non-technical activities such as educational influence and contributions to local communities. We envision a future where public goods can grow sustainably toward their respective goals by using outcome metrics tailored to each project.

By pursuing funding mechanisms that reflect plural values and provide a greater sense of fairness and legitimacy, we bring new light to the Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s build for a positive-sum world together.

私たちは、統計的なアプローチを通して、多様な価値基準に基づいた資金提供を実現します。現状では、公共財はそれぞれ達成したいoutocomeが異なるにも関わらず、同一の価値基準によって意思決定がされます。私たちは、それぞれの公共財が成し遂げたい目標に最適化をして、資金提供できる未来を見据え、Ethereumの持続的な繁栄のためのプロトコルを構築することを目指します。

公共財や資金提供メカニズムのインパクトを評価/測定することで、それぞれが持っている多様な価値観を反映させます。数年前から、インパクトの評価/測定が注目されていますが、オープンソースソフトウェアの効果測定については進んでいる一方で、教育的影響や地域社会への貢献などの非技術的な活動に対する効果検証は不足しています。私たちは、プロジェクトごとに最適な成果指標を用いることで、公共財がそれぞれの目標に向かって持続的に成長できる未来を描いています。

私たちは、多元的な価値観を反映した、より公平で納得感のある資金提供のメカニズムを追求することで、Ethereumエコシステムに新たな光を灯します。 共にポジティブサムな世界を築いていきましょう。
